Implementation Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Applications that need SPICE I-kernel data must ``load'' the I-kernel file,
   normally during program initialization. The SPICE routine FURNSH loads a
   kernel file into the pool as shown below.

      CALL FURNSH ( 'frame_kernel_name' )    -- FORTRAN
      furnsh_c ( "frame_kernel_name" );      -- C
      cspice_furnsh, frame_kernel_name       -- IDL
      cspice_furnsh( 'frame_kernel_name' )   -- MATLAB
      spiceypy.furnsh( 'frame_kernel_name' ) -- PYTHON

   Loading the kernel using the SPICELIB routine FURNSH causes the data
   items and their associated values present in the kernel to become
   associated with a data structure called the ``kernel pool''.

   Once the file has been loaded, the SPICE routine GETFOV (getfov_c in
   C, cspice_getfov in IDL and MATLAB) can be used to retrieve FOV
   parameters for a given instrument or structure.

   The application program may obtain the value(s) for any other IK data
   item using the SPICELIB routines GDPOOL, GIPOOL, GCPOOL (gdpool_c, gipool_c,
   gcpool_c in C, cspice_gdpool, cspice_gipool, cspice_gcpool in IDL and
   MATLAB). See [1] for details.

   This file was created with, and can be updated with a text editor or
   word processor.


Naming Conventions and Conventions for Specifying Data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Data items are specified using ``keyword=value'' assignments [1].
   All keywords referencing values in this I-kernel start with the
   characters `INS' followed by the NAIF RM instrument ID code.
   The WISDOM instrument IDs are defined in [1] as follows:

               Instrument name          ID
               --------------------     -------
               RM_WISDOM_ANT1           -174410
               RM_WISDOM_ANT2           -174420


   The remainder of the keyword is an underscore character followed by
   the unique name of the data item. For example, the boresight of
   WISDOM_ANT1 is specified by

               INS-174410_BORESIGHT

   The upper bound on the length of all keywords is 32 characters.

   If a keyword is included in more than one file, or if the same
   keyword appears more than once within a single file, the last
   assignment supersedes any earlier assignments.


Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   WISDOM was designed to investigate the dielectric properties and structure
   of the near subsurface, down to a depth of 2â€“3 m, with a vertical
   resolution of a few centimeters.

   WISDOM employs two similar dedicated antennas to transmit and receive
   signals over a very large frequency bandwidth. They will be mounted next
   to each other at the rear of the rover, where the interaction with the
   rover body and wheels will be minimized. To enhance the scientific return
   of WISDOM data, polarimetric soundings are planned. As a consequence, each
   antenna has been designed to allow transmission or reception with two
   perpendicular polarizations.


Apparent FOV Layout
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section provides a diagram illustrating the WISDOM detectors apparent
   FOVs layout in the corresponding reference frames.

   The WISDOM Antenna's apparent slit creates a rectangular field of view with
   half cone angle of 40 degrees. The following diagrams illustrate the above
   field of view in the instrument frame:

                 Y                                 X
                  ins                               ins
                ^     /                           ^     /
                |    /                            |    /
                |   /                             |   /
                |  /                              |  /
           X    | /    o                     Y    | /    o
            ins |/   40                       ins |/   40

                |\         Z                      |\         Z
                | \         ins                   | \         ins
                |  \                              |  \
                |   \                             |   \
                |    \                            |    \
                |     \                           |     \
                              Plane X = 0                       Plane Y = 0


   Please note that the FOV reference and cross angles are defined with half
   angle values.


Mounting Alignment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Refer to the latest version of the RM Frames Definition Kernel
   (FK) [1] for the WISDOM reference frames definitions and
   mounting alignment information.


FOV Definitions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section contains definitions for the WISDOM Antennas FOV. These
   definitions are provided in the format required by the SPICE (CSPICE)
   function GETFOV (getfov_c).

   Please note that the FOV reference and cross angles are defined with half
   angle values. The FoV definition corresponds to the NAIF Body Names:
   RM_WISDOM.
