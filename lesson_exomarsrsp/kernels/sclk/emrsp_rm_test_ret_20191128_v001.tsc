RM SCLK File -- TEST DATA -- FICTIONAL
===========================================================================

   This file is a SPICE spacecraft clock (SCLK) kernel containing
   information required for ExoMars RSP Rover Module (RM) on-board
   clock to UTC conversion.

   This file contains the data necessary for converting from ET to
   ticks for the FICTIONAL RM spacecraft clock (clock ID code 174)

   This is intended for study purposes or for those situations in which
   a clock is not available for the structure whose orientation will be
   modelled by a C-kernel.


Production/History of this SCLK file
--------------------------------------------------------

   This file has been manually created by Marc Costa Sitja (ESAC/ESA)
   and contains FICTIONAL DATA. It is intended ONLY for study purposes.
   NO DATA ANALYSIS SHALL BE PERFORMED BASED ON THIS FILE.

   This SCLK kernel is intended to be used with test CK files with
   structure IDs listed below on board the rover -174 (RM):

      RM_ROVER             -174000


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------

   This file must be loaded into the user's program by a call to the
   FURNSH subroutine

          CALL FURNSH ( 'this_file_name; )    -- FORTRAN
          furnsh_c ( "this_file_name" );      -- C
          cspice_furnsh, 'this_file_name'     -- IDL
          cspice_furnsh( 'this_file_name' )   -- MATLAB
          spiceypy.furnsh( 'this_file_name' ) -- PYTHON

   in order to use the SPICELIB SCLK family of subroutines to convert
   RM_ROVER spacecraft on-board clock to ET and vice versa.


SCLK Format
--------------------------------------------------------

   The on-board clock, the conversion for which is provided by this SCLK
   file, consists of two fields:

          SSSSSSSSSS:FFFFF

   where:

          SSSSSSSSSS -- count of on-board seconds

          FFFFF      -- count of fractions of a second with one fraction
                        being 1/65536 of a second; normally this field value
                        is within 0..65535 range.

Kernel DATA
--------------------------------------------------------

   This SCLK file is constructed so that the valid SCLK strings are
   simply the number of TDB seconds that have passed since the Ephemeris
   epoch 2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000.

   For all time, the clock runs at the same rate as TDB. There is only
   one partition for this clock.
